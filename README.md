Implementation of a Bittorrent Tracker for use in a SCION Network.
[SCION](https://www.scion-architecture.net/)
[Bittorrent Client Implementation](https://github.com/martenwallewein/torrent)

This repository is a fork of [crosbymichael/tracker](https://github.com/crosbymichael/tracker)

## Features
- HTTP based tracker
- inmemory and redis Registry

## Differences to a "normal" bittorrent tracker
- Peers hold information about their SCION ISD (Isolation Domain) and AS (Autonomous System)
- HTTP 3 / QUIC based communication 

## Go based HTTP simple bittorrent tracker

You can use this by import the `server` package that implements `http.Handler` to use in your own 
applications or use the binary `bttracker` to create a standalone bittorrent tracker.

You have the option to use an in-memory registry for keeping peer data or using a redis server for storing the 
peer data.  You can always implement your own registry as well.

### Usage

```bash
scionbttracker -h
Usage of scionbttracker:
    -addr=":9090": address of the tracker
    -debug=false: enable debug mode for logging
    -interval=120: interval for when Peers should poll for new peers
    -min-interval=30: min poll interval for new peers
    -redis-addr="": address to a redis server for persistent peer data
    -redis-pass="": password to use to connect to the redis server
```
